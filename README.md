# eVIBES â€“ an Ethereum Blockchain Simulator

Cryptocurrencies and Distributed Ledger technologies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger have received widespread attention over the past few years. With the increasing popularity of Ethereum, there has been an interest in understanding the internals of the system. The decentralized nature of Ethereum and other blockchain technologies makes it difficult to understand how the individual components work. A comprehensive investigation of properties of the network thus plays a signi cant role in understanding its workings and its further development. However, due to the heavy system requirements for deploying a full Ethereum blockchain and high running costs for simulating the blockchain network this becomes a challenging task. In this work, we propose eVIBES, an event-driven, parallel, message-oriented, broadcast-based con gurable Ethereum simulation tool for simulating large-scale Ethereum networks. eVIBES with its con gurable nature can help users to simulate large-scale Ethereum networks and analyze them on a personal computer. eVIBES can thus serve as a useful tool for professionals and beginners alike for gaining practical insights into the system properties and internal working of Ethereum blockchain by running simulations with varying parameters and then analyzing the system behavior.
